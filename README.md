# Will You Be My Valentine?

An interactive Valentine's Day web page built with Astro. Features a playful "Will You Be My Valentine?" prompt where the "No" button progressively becomes harder to click, eventually disappearing entirely.

## Features

- **Evasive "No" button** - teleports on click/hover, shrinks, and fades away
- **Growing "Yes" button** - scales up with each "No" attempt
- **Celebration screen** - confetti and heart burst animations on acceptance
- **Multilingual** - English, French, and Chinese support
- **Responsive** - works on desktop and mobile
